This is an implementation of the Towers of Hanoi problem in x86 assembly. I
wrote this to learn more about x86. I wrote more about
this [on my blog](https://eklitzke.org/towers-of-hanoi-in-x86-assembly).

There are two files, `hanoi.c` which builds `hanoi-c0` and `hanoi-c2`, and
`hanoi.s` which builds `hanoi-asm`. You can build everything with `make`.
