Static schedules
When the
parallel for block is entered, it assigns each thread the set of loop iterations it
is to execute.
A static schedule can be non-optimal, however. This is the case when the
different iterations take different amounts of time


Dymanic Schedules
Here, OpenMP assigns one iteration to each thread. When the thread
finishes, it will be assigned the next iteration that hasnâ€™t been executed yet.


Dynamic Schedule Overhead
Dynamic scheduling is better when the iterations may take very different
amounts of time.
After each iteration, the threads must stop and receive a new value of the loop
variable to use for its next iteration.


Guided Schedules
This scheduling policy is similar to a dynamic schedule, except that the chunk
size changes as the program runs. It begins with big chunks, but then adjusts
to smaller chunk sizes if the workload is imbalanced.
